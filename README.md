# InternetButton-Jenkins

Visualize a jenkins view status with your Particle Photon Internet Button.

The included songs require [my InternetButton library fork](https://github.com/juanger/InternetButton) that allows sharp and flat notes.

## Jenkins Setup

Add a job to your view with the included groovy script (use your own Particle API token and device id)
